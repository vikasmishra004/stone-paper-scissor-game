# Stone-Paper-Scissor Game

A simple Python implementation of the classic Stone-Paper-Scissors game where you play against the computer. This game allows the user to select one of the three options: stone, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects one of them as well. The game then determines the winner based on the rules:

- Stone beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Stone


## Features

- Interactive command-line interface.
- Option to play multiple rounds (extendable).
- Simple logic to determine the winner.
- Python-based with randomization for the computer's choice.

## Deployment

To deploy this project :

- Clone this repository or download the Python file.
- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Run the script in your terminal or IDE

```bash
  python stone_paper_scissors.py
```

- Enter your choice when prompted (stone, paper, or scissors).
